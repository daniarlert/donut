# Donut made in Go

This is a little code experiment that copies [the "donut" code](https://www.a1k0n.net/2006/09/15/obfuscated-c-donut.html) in Go.  

In fact, I heavily used [this article](https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html) where the author explains in very nice detail all the math behind everything.
